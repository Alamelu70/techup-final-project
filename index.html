        <p>Welcome to Recipes from Our Family Table. This site is a labor of love, a collection of recipes passed down from generations, my own recipes created in my kitchen and recipes from others which we have loved. It is meant to be a family "heirloom" that I would like to pass on to my children. Those of you who have chanced on this site, every recipe here has been tried, tested and loved. Served with lots of love from my table to yours.</p>
