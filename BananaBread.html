            <p>I went to Boston to do my Masters over 25 years ago (gosh I am old!). One of my good friends, Whitney, used to make this incredible banana bread and bring it to class. She kindly shared the recipe with me.
</p>
<p>I have to say that the recipe has never failed me. It has been a constant hit!</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Butter - 1/2 cup or 1 stick of butter</li>
    <li>Sugar - 1.5 cups</li>
    <li>Eggs - 2</li>
    <li>Buttermilk - 0.5 cup</li>
    <li>Flour - 2 cups</li>
    <li>Baking soda - 1.5 teaspoons</li>
    <li>Baking powder - 1/4 teaspoons</li>
    <li>Walnuts - chopped - 3/4 cup</li>
    <li>Bananas - very ripe - 2 large or 3 medium bananas - mash them just before adding</li>
    <li>Vanilla - 1 teaspoon</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Cream together the butter and sugar until light yellow and fluffy</li>
    <li>Add eggs and buttermilk to the butter/sugar mixture</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, sift together the dry ingredients - flour, baking soda and baking powder</li>
    <li>Add the sifted dry ingredients to the mixture. I do this in batches to allow the flour to mix in well, and to avoid getting flour all over me</li>
    <li>Finally, add mashed bananas and vanilla </li>
    <li>Add the prepared mixture to 2 loaf pans which have been greased with butter and floured</li>
    <li>Bake at 180degrees for 1 hour. Bread is done when a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Move to cooling rack and allow the bread to cool completely before slicing. Enjoy!</li>

</ul>

<h4>Tips</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Sometimes, when I am unable to find buttermilk, I have used slightly diluted unsweetened plain yoghurt, and the bread has tasted just as good!</li>
    <li>It is really important when baking to use room temperature ingredients. I leave the butter, eggs and any other ingredients from the refridgerator outside to come to room temperature for at least 3-4 hours before baking.</li>
    <li>This is a foolproof recipe. Honestly. Have made it so many times and it always comes out great.</li>
</ul>
