        <p>Sambar is staple in every Tamil Brahmin household, where different variations are cooked every day to be eaten with hot rice and other side dishes. This is the version my mother taught me.</p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>

            <li>In a pressure cooker, combine thovaram paruppu, turmeric and add enough water to cover the paruppu. Close the cooker and cook until you hear one whistle</li>
            <li>In a big pot, add your tamarind solution, dilute it till pot is quarter full. Add a heaped teaspoon of salt and a pinch of tumeric. Let it boil. </li>
            <li>When it is boiling, add your vegetables and enough water to cover the vegetables and a bit of salt. Cook until vegetables are almost done</li>
            <li>Add the cooked thovaram paruppu and sambar powder at this point. Let it boil again</li>
            <li>Add jaggery, let it blend it. Test for seasoning and turn off the flame</li>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Every family has a different way of cooking their sambar. You will find many recipes on the Internet. The key difference will be in the sambar powder used. The above method is by using a premade powder. There is another method with fresh ingredients. Recipe for another day.</li>
            <li>You can any mix of vegetables for your sambar. Whatever vegetables you like, will work.</li>
            <li>A pot of sambar made on a Sunday, can be saved/frozen and used for different meals including as side dish for dosai and idli.</li>
        </ul>
