            <p>This recipe is courtesy of the site, <bonappetit class="com"></bonappetit>. During Covid and lockdowns (circuit breaker in Singapore), everyone became a baker. This was my attempt. And it was moorishly delicious. Have it a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and your taste buds will sing!  </p>

            <p>Recipe is linked <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blueberry-pecan-galette">here</a></p>

        <h4>Tips</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>The dough is hardest to master. You need to make sure that all your ingredients are cold. Sometimes, after preparing the dough, I stick it back in the fridge to ensure that everything chills again.</li>
        <li>Since you are going to the trouble of toasting the pecans and preparing the dough, I would recommend doubling the recipe and keeping the second portion in your freezer for use another time. It lasts a month.</li>
    </ul>
